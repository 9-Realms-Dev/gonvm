# GONVM

gonvm is a version manager for node built in go. This cli will go pull the versions of node from the nodejs.org/dist
and allow you to install them. There is also a TUI that will allos you to see what versions are already installed and
details per version installed.

## Known Issues

- The TUI is not built yet
- There needs to be some changes to have the install work on MacOS
- The install is not working on Windows
